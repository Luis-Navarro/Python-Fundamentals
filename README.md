# Fundamentals of Data Analysis

## Description:
This project aims to investigate about the Anscombe's Quartet, a well-known data-set published by Frncis Anscombe. This data-set will be analysed using Python code.

## Usage
To run this code, please use the Jupyter Notebook file under the name anscombe.ipynb and the csv file named anscombe.csv, where the data-sets are saved.

Jupyter Notebook can be initiated through Anaconda Navigator and it will use your browser to deploy both texts an code, as it includes an interpreter.

All code included in this project is Python 3.6.4. Additional packages needed to run this code are matplotlib and Pandas.

These packages can be individually downloaded and installed as per instructions available in their documentation. However, dowloading an installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) will ensure full compatibility for Linux, Mac and Windows systems.

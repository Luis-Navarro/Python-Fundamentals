    "\n",
    "Francis John Anscombe (13 May 1918 â€“ 17 October 2001) was an English statistician renowned for his works on randomisation, analysis of variance (Anscombre transform, used to stabilise Standard Deviation in Poisson distributions is named after him) and computer statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "He published an article in 1973, titled __Graphs in Statistical Analysis__ in which he focused on the importance of having graphical representation of the variables to be analysed. He illustrated this point by presenting a data-set with particular characteristics. The article, published in The American Statistician, Vol. 27, No. 1. (Feb., 1973), pp. 17-21., can be visited following [this link](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/anscombe1973.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to think that in 1973 the possibility of plotting data-sets was quite tedious and, due to the stage in the availability an development of computer science, quite unaffordable. However, he insisted in the importance of developing graphical analysis systems to avoid misinterpretation of data and constructing weak analysis.\n",

    "This is a well-known data set, consisting in 4 different sets of (x,y) values.Each data-set has a series of x values and dependent y values. \n",

    "Plot 2, on the other hand, represents a clear pattern at first sight, and we can imagine where the perception error is. We were so focused on the linear regression coefficient that we didn't stop to analyse if that was the best fit for a regression model. It seems cler that regression model for set number 2 could be better fit in a curve than in a straight line.\n",
    "And plots 3 and 4 both, even with a completely different distribution, fall under the same problem: outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a well-known problem for scientifists that the presence of extreme cases in an otherwise constant distribution will create interferences in the general model. In fact, a quite common work-around consists in identifying outliers and excluding them from the general model.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Anscombe presented his famous Quartet in a paper titled _Graphs in Statistical Analysis_ in 1973. By the time, graphical representation technologies were in a very early stage. Computer science was still a discipline in development, with expensive and scarce computers available for the common researcher or student. Furhermore, their computational capabilities were light-yers away from those in ournowadays personal computers or cell phones. Anscombe, as an expert in scientific anlysis, states in this article \n",
    ">>_\"A computer should make both calculations and graphs. Both sorts of output should be studied; each will contribute to understanding.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thought, related to the need of developing tools for analysis, is rooted in the statistical science applied to analytical tasks. Anscombe proves the importance of combining calculations, but also of testing graphical distribution, since both can help the researcher to understand the reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anscombe's Quartet Legacy. The Datasaurius Dozen\n",
    "\n",
    "45 years after Ascombe's article was published, it still echoes and is shown as a brilliant piece of scientific literature, clearly exposing the main thesis and proving them by means of a surprising, but scientifically accurate exposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the research period to ellaborate this project, I have come accross a very interesting article in which authors want to pay tribute to Anscombe, creating a new set of 12 surprising data-sets. I do recommend a visit to this article, which can be found [through this link](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats).\n"
